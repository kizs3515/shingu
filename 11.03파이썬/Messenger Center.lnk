Yesterday I lost my lover never had it so good
now you've gone and left me I've been alone all night long
and this morning I find myself waiting for u...
I want you to tell me baby why you left me
oh for so long I was so afraid in side to open up and let love have a chance
and then you appeared and u knocked down my defence
you touched my soul and reached inside 
and change my world with your love
oh please let me love u more and more
you're the reason that I live. the only one I want is you
baby I love you don't say goodbye
what you've given me I'm gonna give back to you
I'm gonna give u baby what you've given me oh~love
what you've given me I'm gonna give back to you
